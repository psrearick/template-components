        <p>
          I tailor each website I develop to my client’s specific requirements.
          For the service to be most effective, I need a clear picture of your
          company's values, goals, and needs. We begin the process with dialogue
          about your business. We will discuss your current marketing strategy -
          what’s working and what isn’t. That way, we can better understand the
          role of a new website in the marketing plan.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          By the end of this consultation, you should come away with the
          information you need to decide if a new site would help you market
          your services. I would go away knowing enough to develop a plan for
          creating a website to meet your needs.

        <h5 class="">Contract</h5>
        <p>
          Once we have decided to move forward, I will prepare a contract to
          protect us both. Based on our previous discussion, it will include the
          scope of work and timeline. The agreement will also cover the specific
          payment terms, intellectual property ownership, and dispute
          resolution. The contract will define the change order process to
          define what happens in the scope of work that would need to be changed
          after the contract is signed. The contract is a critical piece of the
          process. By carefully reviewing and agreeing upon the contract terms,
          we can both be confident in the successful completion of the project.
          Once we both have signed the contract, we can move on to the next
          step.

        <h5 class="">Invoice</h5>
        <p>
          Once the contract is signed, I will send you an invoice for the amount
          we agreed to in the contract. This amount is usually fifty percent of
          the price for the completed website. The remaining portion and any
          additional fees, such as for hosting, will be paid upon project
          completion.

        <h5 class="">Plan</h5>
        <p>
          We will then discuss the website's design more in-depth and
          collaboratively than the initial consultation. We will discuss the
          plan for each web page, including text, images, and overall design. We
          will end this conversation with a clear understanding of the style and
          content of the website. If any assets are required, such as images,
          color palettes, logos, or copy, I will request them now.

        <h5 class="">Design</h5>
        <p>
          While you gather the required assets, I will work on an outline of the
          website design based on our previous conversations. It will thoroughly
          cover each aspect of the site. I will send you the design for
          approval.

        <h5 class="">Code</h5>
        <p>
          Once the design is approved and you have provided all required assets,
          I will write the code for the website, implementing the agreed-upon
          plan. This part of the process can have a relatively wide duration
          range, depending on the complexity of the project. The development
          process could be a day or several weeks. I will update you on its
          progress periodically, regardless of how long it takes.

        </div>
        <h5 class="">Review</h5>
        <p>
          As we approach the finish line, I will make the website available as a
          public demo for you to review. If you disapprove of the result, we can
          make minor modifications as allowed in the contract. Significant
          changes will require additional agreements. The need for significant
          changes is a relatively uncommon occurrence.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          Once you approve the site, I will send you an invoice for the
          remaining amount you still need to pay. Additionally, I will send a
          recurring invoice if you choose me to host your website.

        <p>
          It’s finally time for the site to go live. I will move the website to
          the agreed-upon hosting provider with the correct domain name.
